<p>
  Safety and simplicity: Swift is designed to be a safer and simpler language than Objective-C. Swift has a syntax that is more concise and readable than Objective-C, which can make it easier to write and maintain code. Additionally, Swift has features like optionals and type inference that make it easier to avoid common errors like null pointer exceptions and type mismatches.

Performance: Swift is faster than Objective-C, thanks to its modern design and use of advanced compiler optimization techniques. Swift is also designed to take advantage of modern hardware, like multi-core processors, which can result in faster performance.

Interoperability: Swift is fully interoperable with Objective-C, which means you can use both languages in the same project. This allows developers to gradually transition from Objective-C to Swift as they adopt the new language.

Support for modern programming concepts: Swift supports modern programming concepts like functional programming, which can make it easier to write code that is concise, reusable, and easier to reason about. Swift also supports features like closures and generics, which can make it easier to write generic code that works with a wide range of data types.

Open source: Swift is open source, which means that anyone can contribute to its development. This has resulted in a vibrant community of developers who contribute to the language and its ecosystem, including third-party libraries, tools, and frameworks.
